ok, kick off like 10 agents or teams to understand my LSP

Ok, so kick off a ton of agents to understand the proper way to test an integration like this. Even possibly beyond unit testing. I ship changes here all the time and they almost always break even with decent test coverage

---

so the common issue is usually the LSP hangs. I.E. I hover on some field and then try to save after an edit and it just hangs indefinitely

---

yes implement these
