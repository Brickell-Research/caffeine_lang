### Prompt 1

ok, kick off like 10 agents or teams to understand my LSP

### Prompt 2

Ok, so kick off a ton of agents to understand the proper way to test an integration like this. Even possibly beyond unit testing. I ship changes here all the time and they almost always break even with decent test coverage

### Prompt 3

### Prompt 4

yes implement these

### Prompt 5
